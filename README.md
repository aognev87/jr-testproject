Simple Java CRUD app

That's my first Java CRUD application using:
  - maven;
  - spring;
  - hibernate;
  - spring MVC;
  - tomcat;
  - MySQL.
  
After installing this project with maven and deploying it on tomcat server at first time the process can take a little time to initiate and fill the MySQL DB with data for testing.
